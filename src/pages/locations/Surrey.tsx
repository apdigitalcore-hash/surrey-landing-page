    question: 'Do you run Google Ads for Surrey businesses?',
    answer: 'Yes — we run both Google Ads and Meta Ads for Surrey businesses. Which platform we prioritize depends on your business type. For high-intent searches like "plumber Surrey" or "electrician near me," Google Ads typically delivers the best results. For awareness and retargeting — salons, coaches, and health & wellness — Meta Ads often wins. We recommend the right mix after your free strategy call.',

If you run a local service business in Surrey, we can build a campaign for you.',

    answer: 'The founder, Arjun Sharma, personally manages every single account — no outsourcing, no handing you off to a junior team member. We also work month-to-month with no lock-in contracts, so we earn your business every month by actually delivering results. Most Surrey marketing agencies put you through a sales team, then hand your account to a generalist. We don\'t operate that way.',

            Surrey is one of the fastest-growing cities in Metro Vancouver — and the competition for local customers is only intensifying.

          <div className="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Surrey, BC is no longer just a bedroom community — it's a full economic hub with distinct neighbourhoods each carrying their own commercial energy. Newton has a dense population of service-hungry households. Guildford is a retail and service corridor where competition among trades and beauty businesses is fierce. South Surrey and White Rock attract higher-income demographics actively searching for premium service providers. Cloverdale and Whalley are home to a growing number of small business owners who need a digital marketing agency in Surrey BC that actually understands their local market. Running generic, city-wide campaigns doesn't cut it here — neighbourhood-level targeting is what separates the businesses that get booked solid from those that wonder why their ads aren't working.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shift toward digital-first customer behaviour in Surrey has accelerated dramatically. Surrey small business marketing is no longer optional — it's the primary growth lever. When a homeowner in Guildford needs an HVAC technician, they're not flipping through a directory. They're searching on Google or scrolling Facebook and Instagram. When someone in South Surrey is looking for a new salon, they're clicking on ads they see in their feed. Lead generation in Surrey now happens almost entirely online, and the businesses that invest in Meta Ads and Google Ads are capturing that demand while competitors who rely on word-of-mouth slowly fade. The window to build a dominant local presence before your niche gets saturated is still open — but it won't stay open forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes paid advertising uniquely powerful for a marketing agency Surrey clients can trust is the precision of targeting. Unlike SEO, which takes months to compound, a well-structured Google Ads or Meta Ads campaign for a Surrey business can generate qualified leads within days of going live. We geo-target specific postal codes in Newton, Guildford, South Surrey, Cloverdale, and Whalley so your ad budget reaches the exact neighbourhoods where your ideal customers live. For trades businesses, this means fewer wasted clicks from outside your service radius. For salons, it means filling chairs with local clients who are actually within driving distance. For realtors, it means reaching motivated buyers and sellers in the specific Surrey submarkets you specialize in — not wasting impressions on people who'll never convert.
